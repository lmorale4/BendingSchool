# Bending School

This is a small project I built at Fullstack Acedemy for fun!

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Start the build process and the application with: `npm run start:dev`. If you are using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
4. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`

## Details

### The tools

This project used Express to handle HTTP requests, Sequelize to interface with the database and React, Redux and React-Redux on the front-end.
